title: '`unnest_wider()` issue'

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```


```{r, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)

df <- read_rds("pesky_df.rds")

str(df)
```


`results` is a named list with an integer scalar value for each named element. This should be useable by `unnest_wider()` to create column names from the list names. 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
df %>% 
  unnest_wider(results)
```

I receive the following error.

> Error in `[[<-.data.frame`(`*tmp*`, col, value = list(bidenj = list(...1 = 1129L), : replacement has 12 rows, data has 1

This tells me that for some reason `unnest_wider()` was attempting to make one row per observation.

I tried reproducing this error, but cannot. It is an identical problem to the documented example except without NAs. 

```{r}
ex_df <- tibble(
  x = 1:2,
  y = list(c(a = 1, b = 2), c(a = 10, b = 11, c = 12))
)

ex_df %>% unnest_wider(y)
```

The solution was to `unlist()` then `list()` the column back together. When this is done `unnest_wider()` works. 

```{r}
df %>% 
  mutate(results = list(unlist(results))) %>% 
  unnest_wider(results)
```
